## 1. Data Collection & Cleaning  

A **high-quality dataset** is crucial for any predictive model. This project uses the **[Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)** from Kaggle, which contains customer demographics, service usage, billing details, and churn labels.  

### **Key Preprocessing Steps:**  
**Data Standardization:** Categorical values converted into machine-readable format.  
**Missing Value Treatment:** Missing `TotalCharges` values replaced to maintain data integrity.  
**Feature Encoding:** Yes/No responses converted to binary format.  
**Data Type Optimization:** Ensured proper numerical and categorical data formats.  
**Unnecessary Columns Removed:** `customerID` dropped for efficiency.  
**Final Dataset Saved:** Processed dataset stored for further analysis.  

---

## 2. SQL-Based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

This phase leverages **SQL to uncover key churn patterns**, segment customers, and assess the financial impact of churn.  

### **Key Findings & Business Impact**  
**High churn rate (26.54%)**, with **month-to-month contracts** showing the highest churn (42.71%).  
**Fiber Optic users churn the most (41.89%)**, potentially due to cost concerns.  
**Customers paying via Electronic Check (45.29% churn rate)** are at higher risk.  
**Churned customers pay higher monthly charges ($74.44) but have shorter tenures (18 months).**  
**Senior citizens churn more (41.68%)**, possibly due to pricing sensitivity.  

**Retention Recommendations:** Encourage **long-term contracts**, optimize **pricing models**, promote **auto-payments**, and implement **proactive early retention efforts**.

---

## 3. Python-Based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

This section leverages **Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn) to visualize churn trends**, identify customer behavior patterns, and validate SQL-based findings.

### **Key Findings & Business Impact**  
**Churn Distribution**: 1 in 4 customers leave → **Stronger engagement programs needed**.  
**Tenure & Churn**: Most churned customers leave **within 18 months** → **Early retention strategies crucial**.  
**Pricing Sensitivity**: Churned customers have **higher monthly charges ($74) than retained ones ($61)** → **Discounted long-term plans could help**.  
**Contract Type & Churn**: **Month-to-month contracts drive the highest churn** → **Encourage annual contracts**.  
**Payment Method & Churn**: **Electronic Check users churn most (~45%)** → **Promote automated payments**.  
**Feature Correlation**: Tenure and contract type are **strongest churn predictors** → **Customer longevity is key**.  

**Retention Recommendations:** Introduce **contract-based incentives**, offer **targeted discounts**, improve **customer onboarding**, and promote **auto-payments**.

## 4. Feature Engineering & Machine Learning  

### **1. Problem Statement**  
Customer churn is a **critical issue** in subscription-based businesses, impacting revenue and retention. The objective of this phase was to build a **high-performing machine learning model** that accurately predicts churn.  

**Key Challenges Addressed:**  
Handling **missing values** and incorrect data types.  
**Feature engineering** to create meaningful variables.  
**Balancing class imbalance** to prevent biased predictions.  
Choosing a **model that optimizes precision, recall, and interpretability**.  
Fine-tuning **hyperparameters** for the best performance.  

---

### **2. Key Challenges & Solutions**  

#### **Challenge 1: Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values**  
- **Issue:** `TotalCharges` contained missing values, and categorical variables were not encoded.  
- **Solution:** Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric, encoded categorical variables, and created **AutoPayment flag**.  
- **Impact:** **Ensured model interpretability and consistency.**  

#### **Challenge 2: Feature Engineering**  
- **Issue:** Raw data lacked behavioral insights.  
- **Solution:** Created new **meaningful features**:  
  `TenureCategory` (Short, Medium, Long-term customers).  
  `MonthlyChargesCategory` (Low, Medium, High, Very High spending).  
  `SupportServices` (Bundled security & tech support).  
  `AutoPayment` (Manual vs. Automatic payments).  
- **Impact:** **Enhanced model performance and business explainability.**  

#### **Challenge 3: Class Imbalance**  
- **Issue:** **Only 26.5% of customers churned**, causing model bias.  
- **Solution:** Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to rebalance dataset.  
- **Impact:** **Improved churn prediction accuracy.**  

#### **Challenge 4: Model Selection**  
- **Issue:** Needed a model balancing interpretability and performance.  
- **Solution:** Tested **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost** → **XGBoost selected as best performer**.  
- **Impact:** **Final model achieved AUC-ROC Score of 0.8239**.  

#### **Challenge 5: Hyperparameter Optimization**  
- **Issue:** Default parameters led to **suboptimal recall and precision**.  
- **Solution:** Used **GridSearchCV** to optimize:  
  `learning_rate = 0.05`  
  `max_depth = 6`  
  `n_estimators = 200`  
  `scale_pos_weight = 2.5`  
- **Impact:** **AUC-ROC improved to 0.8346.**  

#### **Challenge 6: Threshold Optimization**  
- **Issue:** Default **0.5 threshold** missed many actual churners.  
- **Solution:** **Optimized threshold to 0.3334 using Precision-Recall Curve**.  
- **Impact:** **85% of churners now correctly identified, reducing business losses.**

# 7. Key Takeaways & Business Insights  

**Churn prediction is crucial for business profitability.**  
By identifying at-risk customers early, businesses can **proactively engage them** and reduce **churn-related revenue losses**.  

**Long-term contracts reduce churn.**  
Encouraging customers to move from **month-to-month** to **annual contracts** significantly improves **retention**.  

**Auto-payment methods reduce churn risk.**  
Customers paying via **Electronic Check** have the **highest churn rate**, while those using **Credit Cards & Bank Transfers** stay longer.  

**Pricing and service bundles matter.**  
Customers with **higher monthly charges** and **no add-on services** are **more likely to churn**. Offering **discounts** and **bundled services** can **increase retention**.  

**Early intervention is key.**  
Customers with **less than 18 months of tenure** are at the **highest risk**. Businesses must focus on **onboarding experiences, engagement programs, and personalized offers**.
